Preparing to run NMSSM EWSB. Specifiying low-energy parameters and running using random_sampling/nmssm_runner_ewsb.py. Approximate output size per successful point is ~~40KB. Time per point is about 1/3 sec.
NMSSM parameter specifications are the following (for NMSSM/sampling_NMSSM_EWSB.cfg):

"Ml2","Ml3","Mr2","Mr3","Mq2","Mq3","Mu2","Mu3","Md2","Md3","MG1","MG2","MG3" <-- 100...2000
"At","Ab","Al", "Au","Ad","Am" <-- -2000...2000
"mu" <-- -2000...2000
"tb" <-- 1...60
"LambdQ","KappaQ", <-- 0...1
"aLmbdQ","aKappQ", <-- -2000...2000
"MZ", "alfEMZ","alfSMZ","McMc","MbMb","Mtp" <-- keep default
"Mm","Ml" <- mu, tau lepton masses; keep default
"wt", "wZ","wW" <- t, Z, W widths; keep default

Added a few lines to main.c that use hdecay to calculate higgs->gamma gamma branching ratio. Expects the hdecay runtime to be present in ./hdecay/run

A general NMSSM sampling model is implemented in micromegas_2.4.5/MSSM/main.c
It takes input parameters from the stdin (see the code) and produces output to the stdout (see the code).
The input can be generated for 2 scenarios currently: 3G-MSSM and GUT-MSSM. The ranges for input parameters are specified in the relevant config files.
